# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This job is named "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Define the Node.js versions to test against
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x] # You can add other versions like [18.x, 20.x]

    steps:
      # 1. Get the code from your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up the specified version of Node.js
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm' # This speeds up future builds by caching dependencies

      # 3. Install all project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # 4. Build the project (compile TypeScript to JavaScript)
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # 5. Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
